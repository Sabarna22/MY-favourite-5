Football is my favourite hobby. My favourite football player is Lional Messi. It’s a team
sport, in which you can score only by placing
the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
Teams content 11 players – field players and a
goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
the goal. I enjoy playing football in my free time with my Friends.</p>
